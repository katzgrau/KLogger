# KLogger: A Simple Logging Class For PHP

A project written by Kenny Katzgrau and originally hosted at
[CodeFury.net](http://codefury.net/projects/klogger/). This marks the
development of a newer version of KLogger.

## About

KLogger is an easy-to-use logging class for PHP. It supports standard log levels
like debug, info, warn, error, and fatal. Additionally, it isn't naive about
file permissions (which is expected). It was meant to be a class that you could
quickly include into a project and have working right away.

The class was written in 2008, but I have since received a number of emails both
saying 'thanks' and asking me to add features.

This github project will host the development of the next version of KLogger.
The original version of KLogger is tagged as version 0.1, and is available for
download [here](http://github.com/katzgrau/KLogger/downloads).

## Basic Usage

    $log = new KLogger('/var/log/'); # Specify the log directory
    $log->logInfo('Returned a million search results'); //Prints to the log file
    $log->logFatal('Oh dear.'); //Prints to the log file
    $log->logInfo('Here is an object', $obj); //Prints to the log file with a dump of the object
    $log->logInfo('Here is a Group', 'Group name'); //Prints to the log file with a group before the message

## Goals

All of KLogger's internal goals have been met (there used to be a list here).
If you have a feature request, send it to katzgrau@gmail.com

## Why use KLogger?

Why not? Just drop it in and go. If it saves you time and does what you need,
go for it! Take a line from the book of our C-code fathers: "`build` upon the
work of others".

## Who uses KLogger?

Klogger has been used in projects at:

    * The University of Iowa
    * The University of Laverne
    * The New Jersey Institute of Technology
    * Middlesex Hospital in NJ

Additionally, it's been used in numerous projects, both commercial and personal.
